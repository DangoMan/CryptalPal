Taking CO 487 in waterloo alone is boring, the math is a bit simple and your hand is still relatively clean after that course.

So that is why I decides to finish something that I started a year ago.

This has become more of the challenge where I want to get something productive done.

There is no goal, it's a to finish as much as I can and get the most enjoyment out of it :D

Also why Java? Since no one in the right mind will use it.... I will revisit this challenge in C once I finish this in Java for the purpose of learning openssl, but for now I wanted to finish it in java first since I already have a few methods that makes the challenge easier

Rules:

Advoid methods that trivalize the problem set.

I will allow the Cipher class just for the sole purpose to compute ONE Aes block operation at a time, so I have to use a loop to encode the entier thing.
