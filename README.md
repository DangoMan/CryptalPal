Taking CO 487 in waterloo alone is boring, the math is a bit simple and your hand is still relatively clean after that course.

So that is why I decides to finish something that I started a year ago.

This has become more of the challenge where I want to get something productive done, but seeder and Machine learning feels stale 

There is no goal, it's a to finish as much as I can and get the most enjoyment out of it :D
